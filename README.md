# Bike_Share_Analysis_Visualization
It is analysis of geospatial bike sharing data with the help of folium and pandas.

Here pandas and folium along with matplotlib is used to analyze the geospatial data which represents bike sharing in the city of
chicago.

The data for this project is found at ![Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/)

![Fig-1](https://github.com/Palash09/Bike_Share_Analysis_Visualization/blob/master/Fig.1.png)

This shows the trip duration in minutes for all the trips

![Fig-2](https://github.com/Palash09/Bike_Share_Analysis_Visualization/blob/master/Fig.2.png)

When we are visualizing the trip duration results by grouping them under the customers and subscribers categories. This helps in
understanding the results in much better way.

There are lot of trips with short duration, as can be seen in this chart. So, I have removed the trips with this short duration.

Chart when short duration trips has been removed from the dataset.

![Map-1](https://github.com/Palash09/Bike_Share_Analysis_Visualization/blob/master/Map-1.png)

This map shows bike stations which are present in the given region.

![Map-2](https://github.com/Palash09/Bike_Share_Analysis_Visualization/blob/master/Map-2.png)

This heatmap depicts the distribution of subscriber and customer in the region. The red region the in map shows excessive usage
and other parts show the extent of bikes used.

From the maps above, inference made suggests that tourists get on a bike to experience Chicago in a different way before continuing with other parts of their trip.

The map shows that regular customers who subscribed annually, have a bit more spread out to the neighborhoods. It means they
are performing their daily work through this bike, before they place the bikes back to point from where they took it
